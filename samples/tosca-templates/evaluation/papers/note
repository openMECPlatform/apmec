We have 5 VNFs, each node randomly 3 VNFs among them

IDS: Suricata, Snort, and Bro
https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/projects/suricata/wiki/Suricata_Installation

Install vIMS on a single VM: https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-docker



chain: forwarder - suricata - vIMS. Maximum 3 VNFs at each node

In case, the real topology cannot work:

Use tc delay to simulate latency between host
Use 5 compute nodes, 1 controller node
Maximum 10 VNFs on each node
